A question that often comes up in conversation with developers is "How do I deal with request for estimates?". Usually the person asking the question is frustrated, they know that any estimates they create are pure fiction yet the management always asks for them anyway. Then they ask the real question; "How do you make them stop?".

Well, I usually give the same answer. You don't. Instead you need to ask why are they asking for estimates? What problem are estimates solving for them? Once you understand that you can figure out the best way to help.

## Why we're asked for estimates
 When I listen to developers discuss the problem with estimates, they always come at the problem from the perspective of management not getting that estimates don't work. Their focus is on making management understand their perspective, hammering it home anyway they can. But this is a two way street, if we want management to understand us, we need to understand them. We need to empathise. Management/stakeholders don't ask for estimates for the sheer hell of it, they ask for a reason, and it's our job to figure that out (we are problem solvers after-all, not just code monkeys).

I've found there are three main reasons that someone will ask for estimates:
1. So they prioritise work and plan for the future
2. So they know if work is on schedule or not
3. Management has asked them how long something will take and they need to report it upward

No matter the reason, turning around to this person and saying "I dunno" is supremely unhelpful. In case one you're making it impossible to plan anything, in case two you're robbing them of any sense of control and in case three you're making them look bad in front of their boss. Any of these outcomes will ruin any chance you have at co-operation, you're effectively shutting down the conversation and presenting the relationship as adversarial. Not good footing for a working relationship.

## Can we give accurate estimates
No conversation about estimates is complete with a dive into accuracy. So what's about the reality of the situation? Can we give them accurate estimates? Well  . . no. Hell no. We all know that estimates are usually wrong, at best they're educated guesses, at worst they're delusional and unrealistic. Estimates are so difficult because we're asked for them when we have the least information about the problem.

### Dealing with requests for estimates
So given that accurate estimates are impossible, what do we do? Well here's the thing, they don't want ACCURATE estimates. What they actually want is a sense of control, to know that the work is in safe hands, and estimates are just one way they go about getting that sense of security.

So the first step is to empathise. They want to know how long it will take, you want to know how long it will take? What do we need to figure this out? 

Now it boils down to knowledge and confidence. What you do next depends on how well you understand the problem and the solution. I've broken it down into three steps, least knowledgeable at the start, most knowledgeable at the end. They're not proscriptve, it's just how I've broken it down to help me explain the idea.

Confidence level 1: Don't have a clue: 
Strategy: Research spike

The first thing you need to do is understand what you need to do. If you don't understand the challenge then estimates are impossible. In scrum these are called "research spikes" and they're a great way to scope out potentially difficult work. I usually pencil in two days for these, I'll arrange meetings with stakeholders and dive into the codebase and get a feel for how difficult it is to work within. At the end of the two days I'll report to a manager on my progress. If things are going badly I'll ask for more time. If things are going well I'll move onto stage 2 or stage 3, depending on my level of confidence.

Confidence level 2. I have an idea
Strategy: Prototype
At this stage you have an idea of what you need to do, but you have no idea as to how you'll actually do it. This usually happens when the codebase is legacy/messy and implementing a solution is non-trivial, you don't really know where you need to change yet. At this stage you don't know how long the final product will take, but you probably have an idea of how long a quick and dirty prototype will take. The goal here is to focus on the happy path and hammer in the functionality, see what works and what breaks, see what parts of the system will fight you. The goal is to gain knowledge, not to write a well written solution. As long as you're clear on this to stakeholders then you'll be fine.

Confidence level 3: I know what needs to be done and where
Strategy: Estimate and do the work
This is the part were you can give management actual estimates. You have the most information you can have about the project without actually completing it, so you're in the best position to plan out and estimate the work. You know what needs to be done, you know what needs to change in the codebase and you know the pain points you'll face. The estimate doesn't need to be accurate, but now you're able to give reasons for your estimates and more importantly you'll be able to present a plan. 

### It's all about communication
The main issue I've found with developers if that they don't want to communicate, instead they want to dictate, to get across their idea, explain why it's superior, then expect management to just back down. This isn't how things go, it's a two way relationship and that requires give and take. It requires communication.

So at each stage of the above report to stakeholders on your progress, not too detailed, just enough so they know if things are on track or not and if you're blocked and need help. You can do this at standups, or you can send them a PM, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that you are open and honest about your progress. They want security, so give it to them.

I've found that once you do the above and succeed, management will feel like everything's in safe hands and will gladly let you work as you need to. You've proven that you can communicate risk and that you understand their needs. Working like this presents the relationship as collaborative, people will want to work with you and will happiliy let you control how you work. Remember, if you make their job easy for them, they'll let you make your job easy for yourself. They don't want to control you, they want to succeed. Enable their success.
