I'm often asked how I deal with estimates. Usually the person asking the question is frustrated and wants management to leave them alone. They know that any estimates they create are pure fiction, complete guesses that are never accurate, yet the business always asks for them anyway. Then they ask the real question; how do you make them stop?

Well, I usually give the same answer. Why are they asking for estimates? What problem are estimates solving for them?

## Why we're asked for estimates
You see, people don't ask for estimates for the sheer hell of it. They're asking for estimates for a reason, and it's your job to figure out that reason and work with them to alleviate the problem that estimates are meant to solve. To do this you need to empathise.

I've found there are two main reasons that someone will ask for estimates:
1. They want to know how long something will take so they know whether things are on track or not and if they need re-prioritise
2. Management has asked them how long something will take and they need to report it upward

Turning around to this person and saying "I dunno" is supremely unhelpful. In case one you're robbing them of any sense of control and in case two you're making them look bad in front of their boss. Doing either of these ruins any chance you have at cooperation, you're effectvely shutting down the conversation and presenting the relationship as adversarial. Not good footing for a working relationship.

## Can we give accurate estimates
But what about the reality of the situation? Can we give them accurate estimates? Well  . . no. Hell no. We all know that estimates are usually wrong, at best they're educated guess, at worst they're delusionally optimistic fanfiction for the future. Anytime someone's estimates are accurate you can guarantee that they've padded the shit out of them (I know I have)

So given that accurate estimates are impossible, what do we do? Well here's the thing, they don't want ACCURATE estimates, they want a sense of control, to know that the work is in safe hands, and estimates are just the way they go about getting that sense of security.

You can respond to requests for estimates in a way that let's them plan for the future, all while accepting that there is a degree of uncertainty.

### Dealing with requests for estimates
This is how I handle requests for estimates, which stage you start at depends on your level of familiarality with the proposed solution and the codebase you'll need to work within.

1. Don't have a clue: Research spike
First thing you need to do is understand what you need to do. If you don't understand the challenge then estimates are impossible. In agile these are usually called " research spikes". I usually pencil in two days for this, I'll arrange meetings with stakeholders and dive into the codebase and get a feel for how difficult it is to work within. At the end of the two days I'll report to a manager on my progress. If things are going badly I'll ask for more time. If things are going well I'll move onto stage 2 or stage 3, depending on my level of confidence.

2. I have an idea, but not much of one: Prototype
At this stage you have an idea of what you need to do, but you have no idea as to how you'll actally do it. It usually happens when the codebase is messy and implementing the solution is non-trivial, you don't really know where you need to change yet. You don't know how long the final product will take, but you probably have an idea of how long a quick and dirty prototype will take. The goal here is to focus on the happy path and hammer in the functionality, see what works and what breaks, see what parts of the system will fight you. The goal is to gain knowledge, not to write a well written solution.

3. I know what needs to be done and where: Estimte the real work
This is the part were you can give management actual estimates. You know what needs to be done, you know what needs to change in the codebase and you know the pain points you'll face. The estimate doesn't need to be accurate, but now you're able to give reasons for your estimates and more importantly you'll be able to present a plan

### It's all about communcation
The main issue I've found with developers if that they don't want to communicate. They want managers to leave them alone to work 

So at eash stage of the above report to stakeholders on your progress, not too detailed, just enough so they know if things are on track or not and if you're blocked and need help. You can do this at standups, or you can send them a PM, doesn't matter. What does matter is that you are open and honest about your progress. They want security, so give it to them.

Once you deliver the above once, management will feel like everythings in safe hands and will gladly let you work as you need to. You've proven that you're able to communicate and that you understand their needs. Working like this presents the relationship as collaborative, people will want to work with you and will happiliy let you control how you work. Remember, if you make their job easy for them, they'll let you make your job easy for yourself.
