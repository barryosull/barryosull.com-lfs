This article is the extension of a rant I had with some friends recently.

This article is about a culture I've seen in the startup world. It's one that's not properly addressed, it's mostly danced around, and I think it's responsible for a lot of the dead companies out there.

It's about the game of investment, why it's played, and how it's eating itself. This article focuses on what it's like to invest in Ireland and England, but I'd wager it's applicable everywhere, as the problem is emergent in any investment system.


# Let's talk about building a B2B business:
If you want to build a scalable business from scratch, there are a couple of steps that you pretty much have to follow. 

## 1. Find businesses with a problem they want solved
First step, find a problem that someone is willing to pay to make go away. If you can't do this, then you don't have a business, no matter how "hyped" you've gotten yourself about a "game changing" idea. Don't focus on a particular solution right now, just find out if there's a real problem. Next find out if more businesses have this kind of problem and are willing to pay to solve it. If you've gotten this far, then you're confident there's a shared problem that's profitable to solve.

## 2. Iterate on the problem to reach a solution
From that group of people, find a beta customer that's willing to actively work with you to make the problem go away. If you can't do this, then it's actually not a real problem, it's just a nice to have.

To make this work you'll need to work in their office and see how they currently do things. Gather metrics so you know the status quo, you'll need them as frame of reference (and for marketing later on). Work with them to build simple solutions that chip away at their problems until their metrics improve. Build a solution, measure the result, iterate until you hit diminishing returns. Keep it simple. The goal isn't to build a product just yet, simply focus on building a bunch of basic tools/processes that makes things better, ie. makes the metrics improve.

Once you've done this, do the same thing for another potential customer, then another, and another. After a couple you’ll have a solid idea of what brings value and what can be generalised into a product. At this stage you're confident you can build a product to solve the markets needs, ie. you have product market fit.

## 3. Building the product
You now have happy customers (early adopters) and a solid idea of what you need to build. This is the stage where you aim to build a generic, stable product that you can market and sell to others. Honestly, everyone knows this part, there's a ton of writing on the topic that explains this step far better than I ever will.

# Why this doesn't happen
The approach above is the best there is. It’s iterative, stops waste and guarantees there’s a market for your product. 

It’s also the approach that is least likely to get investment, and is therefore; never, ever followed.

## What investors want
To understand why this approach doesn't get investment, we need to understand investors. 
Investors are gamblers, that means they want two things from any investment.
1. Minimal risk
2. Maximal rewards

There are investors that aren't like this, but any serious investment firm has this philosophy.

Ideally investors want a business that has already built and battle tested their product. The business just needs extra funds to scale, ie. more fuel in the tank. Failing that, they'll settle for a business that doesn't have a product, but already has all the signs of product market fit, they just need money to build it.

They don't want to invest in an idea that isn't even formed, that's a crazy idea!

As such, every pitch is designed to market your idea as the best investment. No risk, potentially infinite rewards! 

The problem is, most founders have not

All the metrics, the charts, the stories, their job is to convince the investors that you've already completed step 1 and step 2. I have yet to meet a single founder that has actually done this. They see that there's a problem,

I should know, I've done this multiple times.

## The arms race
So now we have a bunch of founders that are confident in their idea, and need to convince investors that they're product idea is worth investing in, 

The investors push them to get more data, more confidence. The founders double down and make even more outlandish claim, finding any piece of data that makes it look like they're right. Investors realise that all these "sure things" aren't paying off and change their tactics. Founders realise this and adapt their pitches to tell investors what they want to hear. 

Repeat ad-infinitum.

No investor wants to put money into a company that isn't even sure there's a problem to solve. That's a massive risk, so why would you bother?

The problem is, that's exactly what they're doing, they've just convinced themselves that they're not. And worse, the investees have also convinced themselves, so now you're even less likely to succeed, as no one wants to admit that they're guessing. They don't actually understand what is needed.

Now we're in an arms race. Every founder is marketing their product using these tactics, so the investors start to notice 

For a while this works

# The solution
If you want to break out of the above cycle, the only real way 

If we don't, then we're stuck on this loop, constantly bullshitting each, wasting a lot of time and money while never actually solving problems.

Personally, I'm kind sick of it.

So everyone 

Of you could do what basecamp has done. Don't bother with investment, grow your company in a different way.


All this is usually bullshit, you don't know all this, you're just acting like you do so you can get money to build your product.

Now you're in a shitty position, 

As long as investors are sure they only invest in "sure things"




Look at the advice on building pitch deck.

Everyone I know, everyone, skips the first two steps. 

The state of investment
 





Every investor wants someone that already has product market fit, because that’s far less risky to them.

So every founder focusses on making it look like they have product market fix, and just need the cash to build a product. (edited)

This results in a lot of shitty startups, as they have convinced the investors, and most likely themselves, that there really is a market for the product that only lives in their heads.

Investors have created this ecosystem and it’s hurting them massively. It’s led to an arms race of confidence and BS around product market it.

And so most startups fail. The ones that do succeed, I’m starting to think they got lucky and actually hit a real problem.
