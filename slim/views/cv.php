            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am an experienced software developer that has built, maintained & extended high traffic web applications. I've architected and implemented many products and have extensive experience working in existing codebases and improving quality. I am passionate about building software effectively. For the last three years I have been working as a contractor to hone my skills at refactoring and improving legacy systems, now I'm ready to take those skills and apply them in bigger ways.
